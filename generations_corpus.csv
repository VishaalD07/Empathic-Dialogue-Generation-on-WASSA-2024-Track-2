394,14,Very much so. The divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous because of their lifestyle. I always like to hear about celebs who've been married for 15+ years. It's so rare.

394,17,"I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better."
394,18,probably not. I'm not sure whatever happened to him. Do you think Brad was really abusive towards their children like the article mentioned?
394,19,"yes agreed it seems so much and then he was probably insecure and controlling as she was pretty and young they were not happy, cant believe it end in killing tho"

394,27,I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people.

460,2,Hello
460,3,"I do not know if I would call it a tragedy, but it is sad when anybody dies."
460,4,"Yeah. And protections for endangered species are being stripped away. Now, I'm not a hardcore environmentalist, I mean, I recycle and all that, but it's pretty hard to ignore the damage being done."

460,6,"Yes I agree.  It seems particularly sad when it is an endangered species that is being compromised.  I did not see anything in the article about what they planned to do to fix the situation, did you?"
460,7,"Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic."
460,8,"Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic."
460,9,"I agree. The boat or whatever they were on capsizing is basically the only way you could get hurt. This story makes me angry too, how could a ride with so many problems pass inspection 3 days earlier?"
460,10,"Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic."

463,4,Same here.... I hope they can find out what caused it
463,5,It sounds like the people down near the river were the most affected and getting the compensation and that sounds like a poor area to me. I could be wrong but that money could go a long way.
463,6,So sad that the people of that area have to put up with all of this going on
463,7,Honestly I think it is pretty messed up that the company in charge of the mining accident aren't cleaning up the polution effectively.

463,10,Man thats sad. The water supply getting borked messes up so much stuff. I wonder what kind of pollutants were in that mining waste. I know gold miners us emercury to form an amalgam with the gold to catch it from the panning machines. I hope it isnt a ton of heavy metals/mercury in that river.
463,11,"true i wonder what can/will be done for these animals, they should have crews go along and pick up fish struggling to relocate them"

466,1,"Yeah, I hear your argument for sure.  But there is also the point of respecting children's right not to breathe secondhand smoke.  Let's just say only in areas that are made specifically for kids."

530,12,I feel really bad for the innocent people stuck in the middle of that warzone. I don't understand why the middle east is such a hub for conflict. It is really needless.
530,13,I agree. The people highlighted in the story seem to have a true need to find safety somewhere else. Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed.
